Dear Mentor!

I hope this message finds you well.
I am writing to sincerely apologize for the recent issue concerning plagiarism in my work.
I understand the importance of academic integrity and deeply regret my actions.

As my course has not expired yet, I want to clarify my situation.
I have received a request from my company to complete my studies before December 6.
This tight deadline, combined with my work responsibilities, has limited my study time and created significant pressure.

I fully acknowledge that this is not an excuse for my actions, but I wanted to provide context for my situation.
I am genuinely disappointed in myself for not adhering to the standards expected of me.
Your understanding in this matter is greatly appreciated, as failing this project could negatively impact my salary raise.

I assure you that I am committed to rectifying this mistake and learning from it. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards!
Student
