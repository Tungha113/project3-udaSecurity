Dear Mentor!

I am very sorry about this.
My course has not expired yet.
But I have received a request from my company to complete my studies before 6/12.
I am limited in my study time and pressured by work at the company.
Your understanding is greatly appreciated, as failing this project could negatively impact my salary raise.

Best regards!
Mentee
